B0006B2Q50	does it hurt bad?	the box says it is not a toy and that it is not safe for children.looking around the net a bit for low voltage shock effects in children it seems this product will probably not kill your kid.that being said, it actually may do the following:- cause numbness or tingling, muscle contractions, pain, or weakness, a headache, or hearing impairment.- make your child unconscious, stop his breathing, cause seizures, cardiac arrest, damage to his brain, heart, or other organs, or even death.regardless of age, people with heart conditions can also die from it, i think the box also indicates that and that the elderly shouldn't use it either.actual reviewi was obviously not thinking clearly when i bought this product.the odd part is that my dislike has nothing to do with safety.in more than ten years of buying products from the internet this has been my only return.i really thought it was going to be fun as it introduces a physical aspect to competition, but the reality is different.the game is quite dumb and has no point to it other than avoiding pain.perhaps it would be different if you were actually playing something, like space invaders (i know...old, but it makes my point), and you get zapped when you die (in the game that is...).as it stands, you get shocked when you lose and it is not fun.i tried it with several friends (i think it was about 10 people) between about 20 and 45 yo, only one female (i found women hard to convince to use it).not even one liked it.in short: it feels bad and you feel dumb, even if you are tolerant of the pain as it is so pointless.i can't understand the good reviews, i'm sure someone likes this but that many?could they be from friends of those who make it and purchased it for support?i'm in my 30's and race motocross as a hobby (since i was 16 yo) and am also a private pilot.i the risk/adrenaline/excitement tradeoff but this device hasn't given me anything at all.	the shocks are a bit painful.	review
